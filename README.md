Application for reverse word lettering (reverse word without changing order)

## Getting started

First, you need to ensure you have these applications:

- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) — GIT isn't necessary, but is better to have installed
- IDE (I prefer [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)) — It isn't necessary, but in IDE you can look up code
  quicker and nicer.
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - necessary to build a project, sometimes IDE have it pre-installed.
- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11) - This one is mandatory ;)

You can download a project in two ways:

- By GIT, typing in console this command:

 ```
git clone git@gitlab.com:powermilk-default/reverse-words.git
 ```

If you decide to use this one, I assume you know the basics of GIT

- By download ZIP file. You need to just
  download [this file](https://gitlab.com/powermilk-default/reverse-words/-/archive/master/reverse-words.zip).

## Prerequisites

You can build this project with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), so dependencies are automatically downloaded and
imported, but for your information I listed what technologies are used in this repository:

Code:

- [Java JDK](https://www.java.com/pl/download/) - If you want to develop this application, you will
  need [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11).
  Java is a programming language what I used to write this program.

Testing

- [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5) - The testing Framework.

## Running application

This application just presents a solution to some issue, and it can be run itself. It doesn't have `main()` method.

## Running the tests

I use Gradle, so you can run test with this command:

```
gradle test
```

## Built With

* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - Dependency Management

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.
